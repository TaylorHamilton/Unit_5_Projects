                        <p>Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park area according to a report released
                            yesterday by
                            the
                            state DNR. In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park and the
                            surrounding
                            communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs. This compares to only twelve sightings for
                            the
                            entire
                            spring of last year.

                            Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include increasing encroachment by people
                            into
                            former
                            wildlife habitats and new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk and
                            deer
                            being
                            taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.

                            DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they
                            believe
                            they
                            have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already occurred in
                            the
                            west
                            this
                            year from cougar attacks.

                        <p>Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the
                            best
                            long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2
                            minutes
                            off
                            the
                            women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson
                            finished
                            second
                            and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA
                            Track
                            and
                            Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.

                            In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the
                            men's
                            marathon
                            for the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race,
                            Kyle
                            Wills
                            of Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason
                            Wu
                            of
                            Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.

                            This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's
                            history,
                            with
                            over
                            9500 men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and
                            temperatures
                            that
                            never exceeded 85 degrees.

                        <p>Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.

                            Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.

                            Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.

                            If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. Convince the cougar
                            that
                            you
                            are
                            not prey, but a potential danger.

                            In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively.

                    <p>Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, June 3rd, after a final safety inspection. A late blizzard
                        delayed
                        road crews, marking this as one of the latest dates on record for the highway's reopening.

                        Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park and
                        Grand
                        Lake.
                        The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist season
                        will
                        soon be upon us!
